# Railway-Ticketing-System (C++)

Disclaimer: This was a Basic Entry Level Project for DSA, based on C++, which I worked on in my Third Semester in Bahria University Karachi Campus.

In this project of Railway Booking Management System, we will be 
implementing the ability to reserve and modify railway tickets.

We will 
use:

- Linked List Operations 

- Searching Algorithms

- Sorting Algorithms

in order to modify 
and print the data according to userâ€™s needs. 


This is a Basic Implementation of C++ and Data Structure & Algorithm Concepts.

We have 2 
modules in this scenario, where a user or the passenger, has their own 
options while admin has to login separately before having their own 
options. It works from the entering of user details, to payment, to 
printing of tickets and other operations are available as well.

For Further Details About the Project, Please Refer to the Project Report File Attached.
